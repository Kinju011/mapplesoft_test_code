1) SQL query for deleting duplicates records from employee table which does not has primary key

	
	with cte as (select *, row_number() over (partition by 
                	empname, dob
            		order by 
                	empid
        		) row_num
     			from
        		employee
		 )
		delete from cte
		where row_num > 1;


2)what will happen on executation of following query

IF EXISTS (SELECT TOP 1 * FROM dbo.region)
BEGIN
	DROP TABLE dbo.region;
END

as mentioned in 2nd task statement before inserting any data into this table we are executing above query and following operation will performed

first it will check if there are any records available in table by selecting first record in curent scenario there is no record in above table so, condition 
will become false and hence it will not go into condition block of if statement and do nothing after that if want to drop table than
have to check if there is any records exists or not in table if records does not exists than drop the table as follow

if not exists (select top 1* from dbo.region)
begin
	drop table dbo.region
end

for getting employee details whose department id is not available in department table is as below

a) select e.* from emp_table e left join userdetails u on e.deptid = u.id where u.id is null

b) select * from emp_table where deptid not in (select id from userdetails)

from these two query i would not recommend to use query (a) to any developer as it will take much time in filtering after selecting all related data
from result set while query (b) takes less time to get the same result.
